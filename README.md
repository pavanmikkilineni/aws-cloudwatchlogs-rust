# AWS CloudWatch Logs Integration in Rust

This Rust application demonstrates how to integrate with AWS CloudWatch Logs using the AWS SDK for Rust. It allows you to create a log group, log stream, and send log events to AWS CloudWatch Logs. This is a foundational example that can be useful for logging and monitoring your applications in the AWS environment.

## Prerequisites

Before running this code, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- **Rust**: Make sure you have Rust installed on your system.
- **AWS CLI Configuration**: You must have the AWS CLI configured with the necessary credentials and default region. Set the following environment variables:
  - `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`: Your AWS Access Key.
  - `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: Your AWS Secret Access Key.
  - `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION`: Your preferred AWS region.

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/aws-cloudwatch-logs-rust.git
   cd aws-cloudwatch-logs-rust
   
2. **Run the application using Cargo**:

   ```shell
   cargo run
3. **View Logs**:
   To view the logs generated by the application, follow these steps:

    - Open the AWS CloudWatch Logs console in your web browser.

    - In the console, navigate to the log group that was created by the application. You can find it using the name specified in the code, typically "DistiLogs."

    - Within the log group, you'll find a log stream named "ApplicationLogs."

    - Select the log stream to view the log events generated by the Rust application.
       You should see the sample log event that was sent during the application's execution.

That's it! You've successfully run the application and checked the logs in AWS CloudWatch Logs.
